### Azimuth Data formatted as per ASCT+B standard

This is data extracted from the required RDS files, merging it with the corresponding Azimuth annotation files,
and bringing the dataframe into ASCT+B table structure.
The merging of RDS with annotations is to pull out ontology-ID based on ontology-label of every cell type.
This entire activity is done, so that it can be visualized on the CCF reporter.

Azimuth-Reference RDS download links can be found on
the Zenodo URLs at [the Azimuth references webpage](https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/).

Annotation Details are found in each section of an organ at 
[the Azimuth references webpage](https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/).
